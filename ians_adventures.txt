Once upon a time in the bustling city of London, there lived a man named Ian who had a peculiar fondness for alcoholic drinks. Ian's love for gin knew no bounds, and he often found himself sipping on whimsical concoctions throughout the day. One sunny afternoon, however, Ian may have had a few too many fizzy delights, and he felt like a bubbly balloon floating in the air.

With a joyful heart and a funny tummy, Ian decided it was time to head home. Being a responsible fellow, he thought renting a bike was the perfect solution to navigate the winding streets of London. Little did Ian know, the delicious drinks had turned his sense of direction into a playful game of hide-and-seek.

As Ian pedaled through the enchanting streets, the world around him began to spin, and the once straight paths turned into delightful circles. Ian found himself riding in loops, giggling at the unexpected carousel he had created. The Silverbullet team watched from a tracking app in amazement as Ian's bicycle dance brought a touch of joy to London.

However, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Ian realized he had been riding in circles for far too long. With a chuckle and a hiccup, he decided it was time to bid farewell to his trusty two-wheeled companion. With a gentle pat on the bike's frame, Ian left it by the side of the road, continuing his journey on foot, leaving behind a handful of texts for Gemma, to straighten this whole thing out. And so, the tale of Ian's bicycle adventure and his swirly journey became a merry legend to all at Silverbullet.
