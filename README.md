Soz, didn't have time for a full story, wrote a poem instead.
Also soz, didn't have time for proper instructions. Good luck!

Well, it looks like someone was in a rush with this work... 

1. Check the `git log` for the commit hash containing the poem, avoiding any other commits.

2. Please `cherry-pick` the commit from this branch containing the poem onto the "all-silverbullet-stories" branch, 
leaving any other commits from this branch alone.

3. Check the README.md for more instructions.
