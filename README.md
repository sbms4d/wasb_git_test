# Welcome! To the Amazing Silverbullet Stories (ASS) Repo!

In this repo you'll find dozens of interesting stories from our wonderful company, written by our peers.

Check out the files in this repo for more info!

Wait. What do you mean there are no files in the repo?

...

None at all? Just this README.md?

...

Ah crap. I know our team wrote them down into this git repo. You should have seen how excited they were to have all of 
their works documented in one single version controlled tool. Such a shame, they'll be so disappointed...

...

Really? You'll help me get them back? Amazing! Thank you so much for saving my ASS!

Let's try and find some stories. There are 3 that are close to my heart. The first is about our dutiful CEO Ian on his 
way home from work. 

---

1. To get started, `fork` and `clone` this `repository`.

2. Look through our list of `branches` and try and `checkout` the right one! (More instructions will 
appear in the version of the README.md file on each `branch`)

---

Nice! You found the code with Ians story on it. Except, it doesn't look quite right... This isn't the _final_ version, 
we decided to rollback to a previous version!

1. Check the `git log` commit history to find which commit holds the final copy of the story!

2. Use the git reset command to rollback the branch to that version of the story, something like `git reset --hard <commit reference>` should do!

Awesome work! let's find story number 2. This one is about Alex. Check out the Alex branch to continue with the tasks!
