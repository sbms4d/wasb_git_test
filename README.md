# Welcome! To the Amazing Silverbullet Stories (ASS) Repo!

In this repo you'll find dozens of interesting stories from our wonderful company, written by our peers.

Check out the files in this repo for more info!

Wait. What do you mean there are no files in the repo?

...

None at all? Just this README.md?

Ah crap. I know our team wrote them down into this git repo. You should have seen how excited they were to have all of 
their works documented in one single version controlled tool. Such a shame, they'll be so disappointed...

...

Really? You'll help me get them back? Amazing! Thank you so much for saving my ASS!

Let's try and find some stories. There are 3 that are close to my heart. The first is about our dutiful CEO Ian on his 
way home from work.
