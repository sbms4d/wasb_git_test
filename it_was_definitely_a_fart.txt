In a gathering of suits and ties, so neat,
A meeting convened, oh, what a feat!
About information security, they spoke,
A topic quite serious, but not to evoke

Excitement or joy in the hearts of the crowd,
For the subject was dense, and voices were loud.
Slides full of jargon and endless data,
The atmosphere heavy, like a cold elevator.

Amidst the droning, a silence did break,
A sound unexpected, a minor earthquake.
A loud, abrupt toot disrupted the air,
An accidental symphony, a comedic affair.

Eyes darted around, in search of the source,
An innocent face, trying to stay on course.
Laughter erupted, a welcome release,
From the monotony, a moment of peace.

The meeting continued, a bit less mundane,
As giggles and whispers began to reign.
The flatulent symphony, a tale to be told,
A highlight in the meeting, a memory to hold.

So, in the midst of the boring and dry,
A simple fart made spirits soar high.
In the realm of infosec and corporate lore,
A meeting remembered forevermore.
