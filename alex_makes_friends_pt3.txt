The next month was January again.

Alex was tired of searching, and asked everyone to help him find his things.

Everyone in the office snickered, and after that he felt worse.

Umberto took him to the office organisation shelf, and lo, sitting in a box, were all of his things!

Now he wasn't searching anymore, and he wasn't a mad, dirty, desk gremlin anymore.

He was a clean minimalist enthusiast.

He swept everything into the bin,

Including his mouldy shoes.

His desk stayed clean for more than two weeks.

Then we moved offices and...

He became a dirty desk gremlin again!
